SUMMARY:
This program implements the model of:
A. Litwin-Kumar & B. Doiron.  Formation and maintenance of neuronal assemblies through synaptic plasticity.  Nature Communications (2014).

You have the option of running a new (untrained) network or loading a network that has been trained as described in the paper.  Edit runsim.jl to choose.

This code is not at all optimized.  For example, the weights are stored as a dense matrix so loops iterate over many zero entries.

REQUIREMENTS:
This program requires Julia (julialang.org). Tested on Julia 1.0. Loading the trained weights requires HDF5 and the corresponding Julia package.

USE:
To run the simulation, enter the command include("runsim.jl") from a Julia interactive session.
